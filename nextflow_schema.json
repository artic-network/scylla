[Bracken](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken) is then used to give a good estimate of species level abundance in the sample which can be visualised in the report. The Kraken2 workflow mode can be run in real time. See quickstart below for more details.\n\nThe scylla workflow by default uses the PlusPF database that will be downloaded at the start of an analysis, there are expanded metagenomic database options available with the --source parameter but the workflow is not tied to this database and can also be used with custom databases as required.\n\n",
